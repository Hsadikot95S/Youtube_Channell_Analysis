sua7xKN0cPc,Alex The Analyst,SQL Interview Questions and Answers for Beginners | Data Analyst Interview Questions,"Today we look at some SQL Interview Questions. The first questions we look at are Phone interview questions which are generally more broad questions. Then we look at In-Person interview questions which are typically more technical and specific. 

You may get some technical questions during your interview or none at all! It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.

I hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!

ya28cb3zFGE,Alex The Analyst,Data Analyst Salary | 100k with No Experience,"Data Analyst Salary | 100k with No Experience | My Story  // I had absolutely no experience when I started my path to becoming a data analyst. None of my friends were in this field and I really only had myself to push me and figure out what to learn. Over the course of the past 3 years I have learned more than I ever thought possible. I am now a data analyst at a Fortune 500 company making over 100k and it seems a bit surreal. I have a lot more aspirations for my career and I hold myself a little higher knowing I worked incredibly hard to be where I am now.
