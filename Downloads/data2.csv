Word embeddings are a type of natural language processing technique used to represent words in a numerical format, called a vector. The idea behind word embeddings is to capture the meaning of words based on the context in which they appear. This allows the model to understand the similarity and relationships between words, even if they have never seen them before.

Word2Vec is a popular method for creating word embeddings. It uses a neural network to learn the vector representation of words by predicting the surrounding context words given a target word. The neural network is trained on a large corpus of text, and the resulting word vectors are used to represent words in the corpus.

The resulting word vectors have several properties that make them useful for many natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and language modeling.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science.","['yt:cc=on', 'pca tutorial', 'pca dimensionality reduction', 'pca practical tutorials', 'principal component analysis', 'covariance matrix', 'pca in machine learning', 'what is pca', 'dimensionality reduction']",2023-01-18T06:31:13Z,12280,375,,31,PT1H28M31S,hd,false

Computer vision is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which aims to make machines intelligent enough to understand images. As Machine learning (and deep learning) is one of the most active subsets of AI on the planet nowadays, it would be appropriate and sensible to tackle computer vision in a Machine learning framework. To understand the full essence of my to-be-suggested roadmap, it’s important to consider a general machine learning process

Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator.

Sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator. Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be ‘transforms’, that is, they must implement fit and transform methods. The final estimator only needs to implement fit. The transformers in the pipeline can be cached using memory argument.

The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated together while setting different parameters. For this, it enables setting parameters of the various steps using their names and the parameter name separated by a '__', as in the example below. A step’s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting it to 'passthrough' or None.

015vL0cJfA0,Krish Naik,Visualizing High Dimension Data Using UMAP Is A Piece Of Cake Now,"Google colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jV4kOHbpdu0Zc7Ml18kdxaQJxV81vB21?usp=sharing
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel
manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed
from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic
topology. the result is a practical scalable algorithm that is applicable to
real world data. UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with
superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational
restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose
dimension reduction technique for machine learning

k2pofjdxkZ8,Krish Naik,DSA Series-Lets Become a Pro In Queues Data Structures,"A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

A3Xx8qaH8CQ,Krish Naik,DSA Series-Lets Become a Pro In Stacks Data Structures,"Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.

The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameters to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given.

A view holds rows and columns, similar to a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.  You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

xDDlB51dX5E,Krish Naik,Tutorial 6- Indexing In MySQL-MySQL Complete Playlist,"CREATE INDEX statement in SQL is used to create indexes in tables. 
The indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than others.
The user can not see the indexes, and they are just used to speed up queries /searches.
Note: Updating the table with indexes takes a lot of time than updating a table without indexes.
It is because the indexes also need an update. 
So, only create indexes on those columns that will be frequently searched against.

TH8ntzkdtLk,Krish Naik,What Is Smart Contract In Ethereum Blockchain?,"""smart contract"" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.

0JuRzN6T70I,Krish Naik,Tutorial 1- What Is Blockchain?,"KEY TAKEAWAYS
Blockchain is a specific type of database.
It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. 
As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. 
In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.

Code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10Z5fsjKPNqyaI9qMo-mgHb6i9l--Roye?usp=sharing
darts is a Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn. The library also makes it easy to backtest models, and combine the predictions of several models and external regressors. Darts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models. The neural networks can be trained on multiple time series, and some of the models offer probabilistic forecasts.","['yt:cc=on', 'krish naik machine learning', 'krish naik deep learning', 'darts library', 'time series forecasting']",2021-09-25T15:38:20Z,39032,1200,,79,PT11M37S,hd,false

In this tutorial, we will show you how to fine-tune a pretrained model from the Transformers library. In TensorFlow, models can be directly trained using Keras and the fit method. In PyTorch, there is no generic training loop so the 🤗 Transformers library provides an API with the class Trainer to let you fine-tune or train a model from scratch easily.

y9AK1YKRoLg,Krish Naik,Complete Road Map Towards Data Science In 2021,"According to the Harvard Business Review, Data Scientist is “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”. Is this not enough to know more about data science! In the world of data space, the era of Big Data emerged when organizations are dealing with petabytes and exabytes of data. It became very tough for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when popular frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus is on processing the data. And here Data Science plays a big role. Nowadays the growth of data science has been increased in various ways and so one should be ready for the future by learning what data science is and how can we add value to it.

3fzYdnuvEfk,Krish Naik,All Type Of Cross Validation With Python All In 1 Video,"https://github.com/krishnaik06/Types-Of-Cross-Validation
Building machine learning models is an important element of predictive modeling. However, without proper model validation, the confidence that the trained model will generalize well on the unseen data can never be high. Model validation helps in ensuring that the model performs well on new data, and helps in selecting the best model, the parameters, and the accuracy metrics.

In this guide, we will learn the basics and implementation of several model validation techniques, mentioned below:
#crossvalidation
Hold Out Validation
K-fold Cross-Validation.
Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation
Leave One Out Cross-Validation.
Repeated Random Test-Train Splits

sqR154NkwZk,Krish Naik,Deployment Of ML Models Using PyWebIO And Flask In Heroku,"PyWebIO provides a series of imperative functions to obtain user input and output on the browser, turning the browser into a “rich text terminal”, and can be used to build simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO can also be easily integrated into existing Web services. PyWebIO is very suitable for quickly building applications that do not require complex UI.

R3zi7kSRuuI,Krish Naik,Tutorial 4- Julia For Data Science-String In Julia Along With Indepth Functions,"github: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Julia-Programming-With-MAchine-Learning
Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science
Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI and/or the built-in corresponding[clarification needed][20] to ""OpenMP-style"" threads), 
and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is referred to as ""just-ahead-of-time"" (JAOT) in the Julia community, as Julia compiles (on default settings) to machine code before running it.

U0i7-c3Vrgc,Krish Naik,Pytorch Tutorial 1-Pytorch Installation For Deep Learning,"PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library,used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.

A number of pieces of Deep Learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla, Uber's Pyro, HuggingFace's Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, and Catalyst.

PyTorch provides two high-level features:

Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system

The skill sets of software engineers and data scientists are converging, at least when it comes to product-facing data science applications, like building recommender systems. Data scientists are being asked to take care of deployment and productionization, and software engineers are being asked to expand their skill set to include modeling.

UbvkhuqVqUI,Krish Naik,Lets Implement LSTM RNN Models For Univariate Time Series Forecasting- Deep Learning,"In this tutorial, we will explore how to develop a suite of different types of LSTM models for time series forecasting.

The models are demonstrated on small contrived time series problems intended to give the flavor of the type of time series problem being addressed. The chosen configuration of the models is arbitrary and not optimized for each problem; that was not the goal.

r5jVonpFFGA,Krish Naik,How To Stay Relevant in Data Science Industry- Sharing My Experience,"Automation has impacted, and will continue impacting, jobs in many domains. Every single job on this planet is subject to a risk of job replacement by bots – just the intensity might differ. Automation makes running a business more efficient on one hand, and on the other, it keeps on changing the skill set required to stay relevant in the industry.

This inevitably leads to unemployment due to mismatches in the skill set. Let me take you through a few scenarios to illustrate my thoughts.

Hello Everyone,
Today we are going to launch one more ‘giving back to the community’ initiative. So far, in our experience while providing training for data science and while interviewing candidates, we have observed that one of  the things which is most lacking is the intuition and experience to build an end to end machine learning pipeline and architecture.
Hence, we are launching this initiative to discuss various architectures catering to almost all the software industry domains. Here, we will drill down to the nitty-gritty of building a software solution from scratch and discuss various ways to make it scalable and robust. Moreover, we’ll also talk about building your resumes for data science job roles based on your experience and the industry domain that you work in.

26J3bcqhfLE,Krish Naik,How To Develop Multi Output Regression Models With Python- Machine Learning,"Many machine learning algorithms are designed for predicting a single numeric value, referred to simply as regression. Some algorithms do support multioutput regression inherently, such as linear regression and decision trees. There are also special workaround models that can be used to wrap and use those algorithms that do not natively support predicting multiple outputs.

NAPhUDjgG_s,Krish Naik,Tutorial 28-MultiCollinearity In Linear Regression- Part 2,"In regression, ""multicollinearity"" refers to predictors that are correlated with other predictors. Multicollinearity occurs when your model includes multiple factors that are correlated not just to your response variable, but also to each other. In other words, it results when you have factors that are a bit redundant

CKLwvuKWQjo,Krish Naik,Tutorial 14- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum,"In this post I’ll talk about simple addition to classic SGD algorithm, called momentum which almost always works better and faster than Stochastic Gradient Descent. Momentum or SGD with momentum is method which helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. It is one of the most popular optimization algorithms and many state-of-the-art models are trained using it. Before jumping over to the update equations of the algorithm, let’s look at some math that underlies the work of momentum.

wTF6vzS9fy4,Krish Naik,K Nearest Neighbour Easily Explained with Implementation,"In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.[1] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:

In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.
k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.

Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be used to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.

Based on a set of points (let’s think in a bidimensional space as exemplified in the figure), DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement (usually Euclidean distance) and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.
