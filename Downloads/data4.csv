🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Study plan prompt: 
""Act as a coding tutor that creates study plans to help people learn to code. You will be provided with the goal of the student, their time commitment, and resource preferences. You will create a study plan with timelines and links to resources. Only include relevant resources because time is limited.  My first request - ""I want to become a data scientist but I do not know how to code. I can study 10 hours per week and only want video resources. I want to learn to code in python. Create a study plan for me.""

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

0nBqRVNSIOg,Tina Huang,2022 create a vision board/book + plan with me!,"discord: https://discord.gg/Q7rXsdmW (pls go to livestream-chat channel!)

Hey y'all let's create a vision board/book together for 2022 and beyond and plan out our goals to achieve them :) Livestream will follow the format as I outlined in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deIUUboTeig so please check it out if you have a chance :) 

Also to get the most of the session I would recommend getting a notebook and/board (if you're creating a vision board), scissors, glue stick, markers, and other things to decorate with. You can always do this later but if you have the chance please do also print out pictures that represent your vision and/or find some magazines with visuals of your dreams that you can cut out and paste 🐈🐈

This is going to be a super chill workshop and chatting session :) So excited!",,2021-12-28T03:38:05Z,22564,938,,26,PT2H18M33S,hd,false

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

invk7t5YgcU,Tina Huang,"How I design effective study plans for ANY SUBJECT (and stick with them) | trading, coding etc.","Hi friends! Self study is hard! It's hard to design an effective and efficient self study plan and I argue even harder to actually stick with it. It's common to fall into the trap of buying other people's study plans and then giving up. Or falling into tutorial hell and giving up. Or feel frustrated because you feel like you're running around in circles and not seeing progress and giving up. Basically, it's really really easy to give up. So in this video, I'm going to share with you guys 8 crucial ingredients that I incorporate into my study plans. The first 5 is for designing the study plan and the last 3 are to make sure that I actually stick with it. 

There you have it: how I design effective study plans and stick with them!

In this video, I go in depth on how to self study online using online courses and how to not give up like a third of the way in. If you have bought online courses and just never actuallly finished them, you are not alone. An average of only 10% of people actually finish an online course. And I was the 90% too before I developed and went through the process that I talk about in this video.

Be warned, this is a thorough discussion that isn't just tips and tricks - it's going to involve some introspection from you as well. I promise it's worth it though.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

It's about learning, coding, and generally how to get your sh*t together c: 

In this video, I give you my step by step process on how I would learn to code if I could start over again. I also provide you with some of my recommended resources, explain how to choose a project, and specific projects to do. Perhaps most importantly, I give you tips on adopting the correct mindset and mentality that will help you learn to code faster and become better faster (these were my mistakes).

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

vx-x-yXXE9I,Tina Huang,The data science resume that got me my FAANG (MANGA?) job (entry level data scientist),"In this video, I go through the resume that got me into FAANG as a data scientist. The resume is the key to getting that interview, which is definitely the hardest part of the entire application process for a data scientist. Our role is super popular but actual positions few and far between. That's why I spent A LOT of time on this resume to get my foot in the door. We're going to go through this line by line and item by item as I go into the details and roast it hard. Sit back and enjoy! :)

In this video, I go through the 3 key differences between the data science vs software engineering interview. I also give y'all my best tips on how to ace them both. I think this is super helpful if you're applying for both at the same time - just like I did. I previously also made a video on the 5 key differences of software engineering vs data science and how I chose between the two. So if you haven't already, I highly recommend checking that out too. Enjoy! :)

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

This video is a deep dive into MCIT and goes beyond all the stats you can find already online. Arvind and I talk about real experiences of real students and he gives amazing insights into what MCIT is about and if you are someone that should really dedicate yourself to this program. Arvind is not only the director of MCIT, professor, and my past boss (I was a TA for one of his classes), but also an incredible mentor and human being. He's honest, extremely intelligent, caring, and humble (sorry Arvind I know I'm probably embarrassing you haha). I was worried that this interview-style video is too long, but I decided to do very minimal editing and just post it because I think it's just so valuable. I added timestamps though so please feel free to skip around! I really hope you enjoy it and find it useful :)

vaD3ZFFNwhM,Tina Huang,How to learn SQL for data science interview (the minimize effort maximize outcome way),"This is a step by step guide for how I learned SQL for my FANG data science interview. I had never touched SQL before and only had 2 weeks to prepare for my interview. So I made a scientifically-backed study plan to learn SQL most efficiently with the least amount of time and effort. By the end of the 11 days, I felt super confident and prepared. I went on to pass my FANG data science interviews and got the job! 

My motto: Minimize effort and maximize outcome!!

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)
